# HANGMAN-GAME
```
Hangman is a famous game where you must guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman (typically represented as a stick figure) is drawn, symbolizing a hanging. The objective is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn, indicating a loss. It's a popular game for improving vocabulary and word recognition skills.

## Back
 NodeJs - Express - JavaScript - MongoDB - Mongoose 
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

```
Here we have a simple backend that allows us to connect to a MongoDB database and get a random data from the collection of words. We can also add new words to the collection, applying API REST.
```


## Front
 ReactJs - TypeScript - TailwindCSS - Redux - Thunk - Context
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
