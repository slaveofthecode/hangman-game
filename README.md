The game is a simple game of Hangman, where you have to guess the word before the person is hanged. You have 6 attempts to guess the word. If you guess the word, you win, if you don't guess the word, you lose.

## Back
 NodeJs - Express - JavaScript - MongoDB - Mongoose 
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

```
Here we have a simple backend that allows us to connect to a MongoDB database and get a random data from the collection of words. We can also add new words to the collection, applying API REST.
```


## Front
 ReactJs - TypeScript - TailwindCSS - Redux - Thunk - Context
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

```
This project is the front side of the game, where you can play the game of Hangman. In addition, you can add new words to the collection of the words in the databse consuming the API REST (backend) called previously.
```

## Database
MongoDB - Mongoose 

```
The database is a MongoDB database, where we have a collection of words that we can use to play the game. We can also add new words to the collection.
